# DEALING WITH MATRICES IN C

Usually programmers are using Matlab or Python for operations involving matrices. Here it is shown that the same problem can be solved using a lower programing language like C. To run the program you just need a C compiler and than type in the cmd the following command: 
gcc -o main matrix.c main.c
, after that you should get a file called main.exe and then you can simply run it by typing
.\main.exe inside the cmd.
